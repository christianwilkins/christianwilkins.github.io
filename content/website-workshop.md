## Research notes (Jan 25, 2026)

Scannability
- Lead with the most important statement and keep paragraphs short.
- Use headings, bullets, and bold labels to help visitors scan quickly.
- Keep the first screen focused on who you are, what you do, and what to do next.

Now page
- Keep it short: a snapshot of what you are focused on right now.
- Include a clear "last updated" date.
- Update when priorities change; skip the page if it will go stale.

Uses page
- Keep it practical and short; link to a more detailed resources page if needed.

Case studies
- Lead with the problem, your role, the method or approach, and the outcome.
- Keep the story tied to decisions and impact, not a long diary of steps.
